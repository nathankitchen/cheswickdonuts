# Welcome to the SCYC Donut Hunt!
<p class="lead">This page gives instructions for geocaching/treasure hunt where you will find four augmented reality donuts around <a href="https://tynehamvillage.org" target="_blank">Tyneham village</a> on the Isle of Purbeck, England.</p>

<p>To take part, you will need to find small geocaches (old film cannisters) hidden on the route to the beach. These contain a QR code that your phone should be able to scan (just start the camera), which in turn will take you to a webpage containing an Augmented Reality Donut!</p>

<p class="lead text-warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>Donuts only work on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/verifying_device_support_and_user_permission" target="_blank">Apple AR-enabled devices</a>: iOS 11+ with an A9 or later processor (iPhone 6S onward, or any iPad Pro).</p>
